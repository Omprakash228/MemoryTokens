# Memory Tokens - https://github.com/Omprakash228/MemoryTokens

This game is based on the popular guess the card memory game using superhero cards. It uses the ERC-20 & ERC-721 standards for transferring tokens or value from one address to another.

When you pick 2 similar cards you win and the card gets added to your token list and removed from the user grid then the card is added as a MemoryToken(ERC-20) into your wallet as the reward.
